This project aims to create a website where the user is able to find a partner match from any of the 4 available fandoms (Pok√©mon, League of Legends, Valorant, and Anime). This matching is done through a short personality quiz and the top results from that quiz will be filtered through a love calculator and the top compatibility will be returned as a match. Users will be able to see data on their returned match and past matches from when they have previously taken the quiz.
